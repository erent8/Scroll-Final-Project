# Introduction

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are a revolutionary way to govern communities and projects on the blockchain. In this project, you will create a simple DAO contract on the Scroll blockchain, allowing members to join, create proposals, and vote on them.

# What is a DAO?

Imagine an organization where there’s no CEO or board of directors. Instead, everyone gets a say in decision-making. That’s a DAO. At its core, a DAO is a member-governed entity that operates on blockchain technology. It uses smart contracts to automate operations, ensuring transparency and fairness.

# How Does a DAO Work?

- Decentralization: In a traditional company, decisions are made by a central authority. In a DAO, there’s no central figure. Instead, every member can propose and vote on changes. It’s like running a company where everyone has a vote in every decision.

- Autonomy: Smart contracts are the backbone of DAOs. These are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. They handle everything from voting results to fund distribution. For example, in a DAO managing a community fund, a smart contract can automatically release funds for a project once the members vote to approve it.

- Governance: Members usually hold governance tokens, which grant them voting rights. The more tokens you have, the more weight your vote carries. This system ensures that those with a larger stake in the organization have a bigger say in its operations.

# Real-World Examples

- MakerDAO: Manages the stablecoin DAI. Members vote on protocol changes, like adjusting interest rates.

- Aragon: Allows users to create and manage their own DAOs, providing tools for governance and fund management.

- Uniswap: A decentralized exchange governed by a DAO. Token holders propose and vote on protocol changes.

# Project Goals

- Solidity Contract Development: Design and implement a Solidity smart contract for a basic DAO.

- GitHub Documentation: Create a GitHub repository to host your contract code, along with a clear and comprehensive README.md file.

# Core DAO Functionality

# Your DAO contract should include the following features:

# Membership:

- A function to join the DAO by paying a membership fee.

-A way to keep track of members (utilizing map would be one option).

# Proposal Creation:

- A function for members to create proposals with a description and voting deadline.

- Storage for proposal details.

# Voting:

- A function for members to vote on proposals (e.g., "yes" or "no").

- A mechanism to tally votes and determine if a proposal passes based on a quorum.

- Implementation Details

# Solidity: Use Solidity as your smart contract programming language.

- Scroll Sepolia Testnet: Choose the Scroll Sepolia testnet for deployment due to its lower transaction costs and testing environment.

- GitHub: Ensure your README.md file includes:

Clear instructions for compiling and deploying the contract.

- The contract address on the Sepolia testnet.

- A detailed explanation of the contract's functions and data structures.

# Project Checklist

Solidity Contract:

[+] Write the Solidity contract code for the DAO.

[+] Thoroughly test the contract's functions locally.

# Scroll Sepolia Deployment:

[+] Set up your development environment for Scroll.

[+] Compile and deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet.

[+] Verify the contract is working correctly on the testnet.

# GitHub Repository:  [Solidity Smart Contract for DAO](https://github.com/erent8/Scroll-Final-Project/blob/main/Build_Dao.sol)


[+] Create a GitHub repository for your project.

[+] Upload the contract code and create a README.md file.

[+] Document the contract, deployment process, and Sepolia address in the README.md.
