# Introduction

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are a revolutionary way to govern communities and projects on the blockchain. In this project, you will create a simple DAO contract on the Scroll blockchain, allowing members to join, create proposals, and vote on them.

# What is a DAO?

Imagine an organization where there’s no CEO or board of directors. Instead, everyone gets a say in decision-making. That’s a DAO. At its core, a DAO is a member-governed entity that operates on blockchain technology. It uses smart contracts to automate operations, ensuring transparency and fairness.

# How Does a DAO Work?

- Decentralization: In a traditional company, decisions are made by a central authority. In a DAO, there’s no central figure. Instead, every member can propose and vote on changes. It’s like running a company where everyone has a vote in every decision.

- Autonomy: Smart contracts are the backbone of DAOs. These are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. They handle everything from voting results to fund distribution. For example, in a DAO managing a community fund, a smart contract can automatically release funds for a project once the members vote to approve it.

- Governance: Members usually hold governance tokens, which grant them voting rights. The more tokens you have, the more weight your vote carries. This system ensures that those with a larger stake in the organization have a bigger say in its operations.

# Real-World Examples

- MakerDAO: Manages the stablecoin DAI. Members vote on protocol changes, like adjusting interest rates.

- Aragon: Allows users to create and manage their own DAOs, providing tools for governance and fund management.

- Uniswap: A decentralized exchange governed by a DAO. Token holders propose and vote on protocol changes.

# Project Goals

- Solidity Contract Development: Design and implement a Solidity smart contract for a basic DAO.
  - [Solidity Smart Contract for DAO]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/erent8/Scroll-Final-Project/blob/main/Build_Dao.sol)) 

- Scroll Sepolia Deployment: Deploy the contract to the Scroll Sepolia testnet.
    - The procedures are as follows:
    - # SimpleDAO

This is a basic Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) contract written in Solidity and deployed on the Scroll Sepolia testnet.

## Features

- **Membership**: Users can join the DAO by paying a membership fee.
- **Proposal Creation**: Members can create proposals with a description and voting deadline.
- **Voting**: Members can vote on proposals, and the contract automatically tallies votes and determines if a proposal passes.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Truffle
- @truffle/hdwallet-provider

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimpleDAO.git
    cd SimpleDAO
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.secret` file in the root directory and add your wallet's mnemonic phrase.

4. Configure the `truffle-config.js` file with the Scroll Sepolia network settings.

### Compile and Deploy

1. Compile the contract:
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```

2. Deploy the contract to the Scroll Sepolia testnet:
    ```bash
    truffle migrate --network sepolia
    ```

### Contract Address

The deployed contract address on the Scroll Sepolia testnet: `0xYourContractAddress`

### Contract Functions

- `joinMembership()`: Allows users to join the DAO by paying the membership fee.
- `createProposal(string description, uint256 duration)`: Allows members to create proposals.
- `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool supportProposal)`: Allows members to vote on proposals.
- `finalizeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Finalizes the proposal based on the votes.
- `getProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns details of a specific proposal.
- `withdrawFunds()`: Allows the owner to withdraw funds from the contract.

- GitHub Documentation: Create a GitHub repository to host your contract code, along with a clear and comprehensive README.md file.

# Core DAO Functionality

# Your DAO contract should include the following features:

# Membership:

- A function to join the DAO by paying a membership fee.

-A way to keep track of members (utilizing map would be one option).

# Proposal Creation:

- A function for members to create proposals with a description and voting deadline.

- Storage for proposal details.

# Voting:

- A function for members to vote on proposals (e.g., "yes" or "no").

- A mechanism to tally votes and determine if a proposal passes based on a quorum.

- Implementation Details

# Solidity: Use Solidity as your smart contract programming language.

- Scroll Sepolia Testnet: Choose the Scroll Sepolia testnet for deployment due to its lower transaction costs and testing environment.

- GitHub: Ensure your README.md file includes:

Clear instructions for compiling and deploying the contract.

- The contract address on the Sepolia testnet.

- A detailed explanation of the contract's functions and data structures.

# Project Checklist

Solidity Contract:

[] Write the Solidity contract code for the DAO.

[] Thoroughly test the contract's functions locally.

# Scroll Sepolia Deployment:

[] Set up your development environment for Scroll.

[] Compile and deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet.

[] Verify the contract is working correctly on the testnet.

# GitHub Repository:

[] Create a GitHub repository for your project.

[] Upload the contract code and create a README.md file.

[] Document the contract, deployment process, and Sepolia address in the README.md.

# Optional Enhancements (Go Beyond the Basics!)

- Token-Based Voting: Implement voting power based on the number of governance tokens a member holds.

- Proposal Types: Introduce different types of proposals (e.g., financial, rule changes).

- Quadratic Voting: Explore a voting mechanism that reduces the influence of large token holders.

# Final Project: Option 2 - Build Your Own Blockchain Dapp on Scroll

- The world of blockchain is full of possibilities! In this option, you have the freedom to design and create your own decentralized application (Dapp) on the Scroll blockchain. Let your imagination run wild and build a Dapp that solves a problem, enhances an existing system, or introduces something entirely new.

# Project Goals

- Ideation and Concept Development: Brainstorm and refine a unique Dapp concept that leverages the capabilities of the Scroll blockchain.

- Solidity Contract Development: Design and implement a Solidity smart contract to power your Dapp's core functionality.

- Scroll Sepolia Deployment: Deploy your Dapp to the Scroll Sepolia testnet.

- GitHub Documentation: Create a GitHub repository to host your contract code and a comprehensive README.md file.

- Dapp Possibilities (Just to Spark Your Creativity!)

# Decentralized Finance (DeFi):

- Simple Crowdfunding Platform: Allow users to contribute funds to a project and receive tokens in return upon successful completion.

- Escrow Service: Hold funds securely in a smart contract until both parties fulfill their obligations in an agreement (e.g., freelancing platform).

# Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):

- Membership NFT: Grant access to exclusive content or experiences by holding a unique NFT.

- Event Ticketing System: Issue tamper-proof NFT tickets for events, eliminating the risk of counterfeiting.

# Supply Chain Management:

Track and Trace System: Monitor the movement of goods through the supply chain, ensuring transparency and provenance.

# Identity Verification:

Simple KYC (Know Your Customer) Dapp: Verify user identities on-chain using government-issued IDs or other trusted sources.

# Gaming:

- In-Game Item Marketplace: Allow players to buy, sell, and trade unique in-game items securely on the blockchain.

# Social Networks:

Tip Jar Dapp: Enable users to send and receive micropayments to content creators on a social platform.

...and many more! The sky's the limit – come up with something truly original!
